 * Every demosaic in debayer.c takes 8-bit samples, so a sensor profile that
 * captures 10-bit samples in 16-bit words needs one narrowing pass between
 * the capture buffer and the whole tested pipeline. No shipped profile does
 * today - both sensors are read as 8-bit - but the OV8856's 10-bit modes are
 * the fallback if its RAW8 full-resolution mode will not lock on real
 * hardware, so the pass stays covered. It has to read little-endian
 * regardless of host byte order, saturate rather than wrap if the samples
 * turn out not to be right-aligned, and report the peak so that alignment is
 * visible in the log. The Bayer phase must survive it: a BGGR frame narrowed
 * pixel-by-pixel is still BGGR, which is checked by demosaicing a synthetic
 * frame and reading the colors back.
