/*
 * accel.h - the head-accelerometer crash watch: two tiers on the
 * LIS2HH12's own interrupt generators

 *
 * The factory's head crash detector is the head accelerometer itself:
 * the LIS2HH12 carries two on-chip interrupt generators, and the
 * factory arms them per job from the pulse header's HA* tags. IG1
 * takes a per-axis threshold (the alert tier, a pause); IG2 takes one
 * shared threshold (the abort tier, a fail). Both latch into a
 * per-axis source register the watcher polls and clears by reading.
 * ForgeFIRM adopts the mechanism with local thresholds seeded from a
 * captured cut header: X alert 132, Y alert 112, abort 133, IG
 * register units at the +/-4 g run full scale (LSB = full scale/256,
 * ~15.6 mg). Z is never armed - gravity rides it - and the factory
 * ships Z zero in every captured header too.
 *
 * The generators only sample at a running ODR, and st_accel leaves
 * the part in power-down between one-shot reads, so the armed watch
 * owns CTRL1 (800 Hz) and CTRL4 (+/-4 g) for the window and restores
 * both on disarm; every poll re-asserts them, so a one-shot read
 * elsewhere costs at most a tick. The IG registers themselves are
 * ones st_accel never touches, so the watch runs over i2c-dev with
 * the driver bound and the liveness path untouched.
 *
 * Split like airflow.c: the tier logic is pure (the engine feeds the
 * latched sources, the host test feeds numbers); the i2c access sits
 * behind the crash_hw_* calls.
