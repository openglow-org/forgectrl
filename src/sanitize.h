 * A line filter for the log export: known machine-specific values
 * (serial, hostname, credentials, WiFi SSID/PSK) are replaced by named
 * placeholders, and pattern classes (network addresses, e-mail
 * addresses, bearer tokens, long hex/base64 blobs) by numbered
 * placeholders that stay stable within one export, so correlation
 * across files survives. Pure C, no system access: the caller feeds
 * the known values; host unit tests feed fixtures.
