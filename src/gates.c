/* One row per gate setting. The defaults are the factory's coolant
 * window (cool.c carries the measured rationale); the bands are the
 * defaults with the margin one machine's loop was seen to need; the
 * legal ranges are wide on purpose, because a field machine whose
 * sensors read out of line with this bench changes the number rather
 * than patching the firmware, and the far end is how it turns a gate
 * off while the defaults catch up.
 *
 * cool_temp_max: the run ceiling on the upstream coolant sensor. 60 C
 *   is past anything the loop reaches before the tube is already
 *   damaged, so a ceiling there is a gate that never trips.
 * cool_temp_resume: the resume gate under the ceiling. Not a gate of
 *   its own (it follows the ceiling), so no off end; it is warned
 *   outside its band and kept below the ceiling by the settings
 *   cross-check.
 * cool_temp_critical_c: the critical line above the ceiling, a fault
 *   with no resume in the run session where the ceiling is a pause.
 *   Kept above the ceiling by the cross-check while the ceiling is a
 *   gate (a ceiling at its off end leaves the line standing alone);
 *   70 C is past anything the loop reaches, so a line there is the
 *   gate off.
 * cool_temp_min: the coolant floor under the ceiling, a fire gate with
 *   a degree of hysteresis (cool.c). Cold coolant shocks a tube and a
 *   TEC pulling under the dew point condenses on it; the factory's own
 *   floor rides in the pulse header (CMrn) and can only raise this one.
 *   Zero is the gate off.
 * cool_temp_start: the warm-up gate. A run session that opens with the
 *   coolant under it holds with the loop heater on and the fans idle
 *   until the reading reaches the gate, then runs and verifies flow.
 *   Zero is the gate off. Kept between the floor and the ceiling by the
 *   settings cross-check.
 * cool_fire_q1_alert .. cool_fire_q2_critical: the lid-IR fire watch,
 *   the factory's shape. The four channels sorted ascending are the
 *   quartiles; a sustained first or second quartile over its alert is
 *   the pause tier, over its critical the fail tier. The defaults are
 *   the thresholds the factory ships in every pulse header (quartiles
 *   three and four it leaves at zero, off), and they sit far above a
 *   fully lit lid lamp (161 to 177 counts) plus its drift: the watch
 *   catches a developed flame, not a candle. Zero is that tier off.
 * cool_tec_on_c / cool_tec_off_c: the TEC's hysteresis pair on the
 *   upstream reading (on above, off below), used only when
 *   cool_tec_present is set. Not gates of their own (nothing trips);
 *   the settings cross-check keeps off under on, and the engine's
 *   runtime clamp holds the TEC off within a degree of the floor.
 *   The factory turns a Pro's TEC on above its own threshold; what a
 *   Pro sets is unknown (no Pro capture), so these defaults are chosen:
 *   around the observed Pro loop point, above the warm-up gate, above
 *   the dew point of an ordinary room.
 * cool_accel_x_alert .. cool_accel_abort: the head-accelerometer
 *   crash watch, the factory's shape on the LIS2HH12's own interrupt
 *   generators. Values are IG threshold register units at the +/-4 g
 *   run full scale (LSB = full scale/256, ~15.6 mg): the per-axis
 *   alerts are the pause tier (IG1), the shared abort the fail tier
 *   (IG2). The defaults are the factory's own cut and travel header
 *   values (x 132 ~2.06 g, y 112 ~1.75 g, abort 133 ~2.08 g); normal
 *   commanded motion reads under 0.2 g and a rail strike 1.8 g and
 *   up. Z is never armed: gravity rides it. Zero is that tier off.
 * cool_flow_check_s: the flow interrogation window. Zero is no
 *   interrogation at all, the one off-by-value the engine has always
 *   had; the band is the window the characterization found useful.
 * cool_flow_rise: the downstream rise that means stagnant coolant. Set
 *   from flow calibrate; the bench's no-flow rise is about 16 C, so a
 *   value above the band can never fault and is warned as such. Not a
 *   gate of its own (flow is), so no off end.
 * cool_tach_*_min_rpm: the airflow floors, in rpm at run duty, 55
 *   percent of the steady speed the bench machine's fans reach at the
 *   run profile (exhaust 11640, the intakes 4160, the air assist
 *   11050; the bands are 50 to 60 percent); zero is the gate off. A
 *   pulse header's tach window can raise a floor for a job, never
 *   lower it.
 * cool_purge_min_current: the purge-air fan has no tachometer; its
 *   current reads about 1 off and about 630 on, and the floor sits
 *   between. Zero is the gate off.
 * cool_recheck_s: how often the flow check repeats during a job. Zero
 *   is the gate off: a pump that stops mid-job is then undetected until
 *   the next job start.
 * cool_fan_grace_s: the spin-up window after the run profile is
 *   written, during which no floor counts. Not a gate, so no off end. */
