 *
 * One worker thread owns the imx-media pipeline and V4L2 capture node for
 * the selected camera (lid or head - they share the video-mux, so exactly
 * one can stream at a time). The engine starts on demand, publishes the
 * latest half-resolution JPEG for stream clients, serves full-resolution
 * snapshot requests from the same raw frames, and tears the pipeline down
 * after an idle period so one-shot users (gfhardware) can still grab.
 *
 * Geometry is not fixed: it comes from whichever sensor bound (5 MP OV5648
 * or 8 MP OV8856), so callers take the frame size from cam_status rather
 * than assuming one.
 *
 * Privacy: no camera captures unless the lid is closed. Every entry point
 * below refuses while the lid is open, a lid opened mid-capture stops the
 * engine, and the lid check fails closed. This is enforced here rather
 * than at the callers so it covers the panel, stream clients and the
 * cloud client alike.
