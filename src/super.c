 *
 * forgectrl owns the lifecycle of the motion controllers: exactly one
 * of grblHAL (GRBL mode) or gfcloud (Glowforge web-service mode) runs
 * at a time, spawned as a direct child of this daemon. The parent-child
 * relationship is load-bearing: it is how the pulse-device broker hands
 * the controller its fd at spawn, and how a controller death is
 * detected the moment it happens.
 *
 * One thread owns the whole lifecycle (spawn, reap, respawn, stop) and
 * everything else talks to it through a small request mailbox - there
 * is exactly one waitpid() caller for the controller pid. Every
 * transition out of a running child - expected or not, including
 * SIGKILL escalation - safes the machine (cnc/stop + laser latch):
 * under the broker a child exit is not a final close of the pulse
 * device, so these writes are the safing mechanism. Unexpected deaths
 * additionally respawn with backoff.
 *
 * The mode-switch sequence (POST /mode) is idle-gated: stop the active
 * controller, persist controller_mode, start the other, wait for its
 * first job-state report to reach the cooling engine. Diagnostics use
 * the same machinery to take the hardware: suspend (controller down,
 * mode unchanged) and resume - the controller that comes back is the
 * selected mode's, whichever that is.
 *
 * The boot-time init scripts do not start controllers; they defer here.
 * If an unmanaged controller is found running at startup anyway (legacy
 * scripts, manual start), the supervisor stands by rather than fight
 * over the exclusive-open pulse device and the Grbl port.
