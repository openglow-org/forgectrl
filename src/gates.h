 * A gate is a comparison the cooling engine makes against a setting: a
 * ceiling the coolant must stay under, a window the flow check runs
 * for. Every such setting is a plain number on the Machine tab with a
 * wide legal range, and the far end of that range turns the gate off by
 * value: a floor of zero never trips, a ceiling at its maximum never
 * trips. There is no separate switch. Around the shipped default sits a
 * recommended band; a value outside it is legal and warned about, a
 * value at the off end is legal and reported as the gate being off.
 *
 * This module is pure (no I/O) so the validators, the engine, the
 * settings reply and the host tests all read one table.
