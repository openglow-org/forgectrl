 * Renders the superpixel half-resolution BGGR -> YUV420 conversion (the

 * passes, reading the raw frame and writing the encoder's planar YUV420
 * buffer through dmabufs, so the CPU never touches frame data.
 *
 * The GL stack is loaded with dlopen at runtime (libEGL.so.1 /
 * libGLESv2.so.2): the daemon builds and runs on hosts and images with no
 * GL libraries, where gpu_debayer_open simply fails and the caller stays
 * on the NEON path. Every capability the path depends on (surfaceless
 * EGL, dmabuf import, rendering into an imported linear buffer, texture
 * size) is probed at open, never assumed.

 * Threading: one instance, one thread (the camera worker).
