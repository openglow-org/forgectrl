 * The engine publishes its state as JSON fragments it renders once per
 * tick and stitches into one document on request. Every fragment has a
 * fixed-size buffer; a value set that does not fit is a defect, never a
 * cut-off fragment: each formatter returns -1 and leaves a valid empty
 * fragment behind, so the document a client parses is always JSON. The
 * sizes here are the ones the engine uses, and tests/coolfmt_test.c
 * renders the widest legal values into them.
