 * Single owner of the thermal hardware (fans, pump, TEC, loop heater)
 * for every controller mode, per the cooling-engine contract
 * (https://docs.forgefirm.org/technical/forgefirm/cooling-engine/). Job state arrives
 * as level-triggered reports (POST /cool/state, ~1 Hz); the engine
 * publishes its verdict to /run/forgefirm/cooling.state (atomic
 * replace, ~1 Hz). Enforcement - the laser fire gate and feed-hold
 * issuance - stays in-process with the active controller; a reader
 * that finds the verdict file missing or stale treats it as
 * fire-blocked. The hardware AND-gate remains the safety boundary;
 * everything here is equipment protection.
 *
 * Policy, built from the factory's own numbers (captured pulse-file
 * headers + settings map): fan duties AAid=204/AArd=1023, EFrd=65535,
 * IFrd=43278; coolant windows CM* in millidegrees - run ceiling 33 C
 * (CMrx), start/resume gate 31 C (CMwx). All thresholds user-tunable:
 * cool_* keys in the shared machine settings (re-read at every run
 * start), GFCOOL_* env vars as bench overrides that win for the
 * process lifetime.
 *
 * - IDLE: pump on, TEC off, purge on, fans at factory idle, HEATER OFF
 *   (an always-on flow heater measurably warms the loop - ~1.5 C in
 *   minutes - eating headroom below the start gate for no benefit
 *   while nothing can fire).
 * - RUN (reported mode "run", or armed whatever the mode says):
 *   cut-profile fans - per-job duties from the report when given -
 *   plus periodic coolant-flow verification. The flow heater sits
 *   between the two water-temp sensors; each check runs it at
 *   FLOW_HEATER_PCT for FLOW_CHECK_S and reads how far the downstream
 *   sensor climbs (flowing coolant carries the heat away; a stagnant
 *   loop cooks the downstream sensor). Checks repeat every
 *   FLOW_RECHECK_S and start only from a thermally settled loop. An
 *   over-limit reading is a SUSPICION, not a fault: it publishes a
 *   hold request and re-checks immediately, and only a second
 *   consecutive over-limit (no clean check in between) - or a
 *   suspicion unresolved within FLOW_CONFIRM_MAX_S - raises COOLANT
 *   FLOW FAULT. A clean re-check clears the suspicion: transients (a
 *   pump airlock burp, disturbed coolant) self-clear within minutes,
 *   while true stagnation cannot pass a settled re-check. Cleared
 *   suspicions still count - FLOW_TREND_N of them in one job earn an
 *   aggregated check-your-coolant warning.
 * - COOLDOWN (run ends): a smoke-clear phase at run duty, then a
 *   thermal phase at reduced duty (fan airflow measurably cools the
 *   loop) until the upstream temp is back under the resume gate or a
 *   timeout expires; heater off throughout (it would fight the
 *   cooling). A session that never had the armed window open (a
 *   homing motion, a hunt, a dark job) has no smoke to clear: its
 *   smoke phase is zero length, the thermal gate still applies.
 * - TEC: a Pro's chiller, driven only when cool_tec_present is set
 *   (the line has no readback, so presence is the operator's word; a
 *   Basic or a Plus has no part on it). Hysteresis on the upstream
 *   reading, on above cool_tec_on_c and off below cool_tec_off_c, and
 *   only while the fans run (run, smoke clear, thermal, or a forced
 *   cooldown): the cooler's heat sink sits in the airflow path, so no
 *   airflow means no TEC. Off at idle, off in the warm-up hold (it
 *   would fight the heater), off within a degree of the coolant floor
 *   (the settings cross-check keeps the pair above the floor). Turning
 *   off is immediate; turning on again waits a short dwell so sensor
 *   noise cannot chatter the part.
 * - COLD / WARM-UP: the coolant floor (cool_temp_min) is a fire gate
 *   under the ceiling with a degree of hysteresis; the warm-up gate
 *   (cool_temp_start) holds a session that opens under it with the
 *   loop heater on and the fans idle, releases once the bulk reading
 *   (a one-minute rolling minimum upstream, blind to the heater's
 *   slugs passing the sensor) reaches the gate, then
 *   brings the run fans up and requests the flow check on a history
 *   the heater has not touched. Either at its off end (0) is no gate.
 *   A warm-up that stops making progress (the heater's plateau in a
 *   cold room) is named once and keeps holding: no release under the
 *   gate.
 * - OVER-TEMP: if the upstream temp exceeds the run ceiling the
 *   verdict goes OVERTEMP with hold=true and cooling airflow forced;
 *   it recovers (resume_ok) once the temp is back under the resume
 *   gate. The upstream sensor gates because it reads the coolant
 *   entering the tube.
 * - GATE SETTINGS (gates.c): the ceiling, its resume gate, the flow
 *   window and the flow rise are plain settings with a wide legal
 *   range, a recommended band and an off end; a ceiling at its top or
 *   a flow window of zero turns that gate off by value. An off gate is
 *   skipped, still measured, logged at every run start, and published
 *   as gates_off.
 * - AIRFLOW GATES (airflow.c): while the run profile is applied, each
 *   fan is held to a floor (the exhaust, intakes and air assist by
 *   tachometer, the purge fan by current) after a spin-up grace;
 *   three consecutive ticks under the floor trip a fault for the
 *   rest of the run session (verdict AIRFLOW: hold, fire blocked, no
 *   resume), the fans held at run duty. A header's tach window can
 *   raise a floor for a job, never lower it.
 * - Physical-evidence witnesses (1 Hz, alongside the loop): the
 *   kernel's sampled LASER_ON count is the ground truth of emission
 *   (the gated output of the hardware AND-gate, not a commanded
 *   state). Emission sensed with no armed window in the recent past
 *   stops motion and locks the latch; laser power-good degradation
 *   during an armed window is warned. The four lid IR channels are
 *   polled every tick: their run-start baseline and session peaks are
 *   logged every job (the commissioning dataset), and through the run,
 *   smoke and thermal phases the four readings sorted ascending (the
 *   quartiles, the factory's statistic) are judged against two tiers
 *   per quartile, the factory's own shape and defaults. A first or
 *   second quartile over its alert threshold for two ticks is the
 *   pause tier (verdict FLAME, hold, fire blocked; released once the
 *   reading is back under for five ticks) - at least three of the four
 *   channels lit well past the lamp. Over its critical threshold is
 *   the fail tier: motion stopped, latch locked, verdict FIRE with
 *   hold until the next run session, smoke airflow held. Zero is a
 *   tier off; the thresholds sit above a fully lit lid lamp by
 *   construction, so the lamp never trips them - and a candle-sized
 *   flame stays under them too: this catches a developed fire.
 * - Controller silence: if the active controller stops reporting past
 *   REPORT_TIMEOUT_S, fire_ok goes false immediately and the engine
 *   stands down through the normal cooldown path (smoke clear is the
 *   right physical behavior for a job that died mid-cut). Silence with
 *   the armed window open - or with the kernel still playing the ring
 *   (cloud mode preloads whole jobs, so the ring can run for minutes
 *   with no live feeder) - additionally stops motion and locks the
 *   laser latch right here: the supervisor safes controller *deaths*,
 *   this covers controller *hangs*. And while cnc/state still reads
 *   running, exhaust/intake never drop below cooldown duty.
 * - Diagnostics (diag.c) own the hardware while they run: the engine
 *   suspends its writes and publishes fire-blocked until they finish.

 * the check the heater goes off and absolute-temperature monitoring
 * carries the protection (a pump failure mid-cut shows up far faster
 * as a temperature climb than as a heater delta).
 *
 * Duty matters more than anything else here. Below ~40% the stagnant

 * MIMIC FLOW: at 30%/50 s the five no-flow trials read 8.15, 8.69,
