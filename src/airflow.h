 * One gate per fan the engine drives at run duty: the exhaust, the two
 * intakes and the air assist by tachometer, the purge-air fan by its
 * current. Each compares a 1 Hz reading against a floor. A fan needs time
 * to reach speed after the run profile is written, so nothing counts
 * during a grace window; a tach reading wanders, so a trip takes three
 * consecutive ticks under the floor and a good tick clears the count; a
 * trip is a fault for the rest of the run session, because a fan that
 * is not moving the air is not a condition a job resumes through; it
 * ends with the session, and the next one judges every fan afresh.
 * A floor at or below zero is the gate turned off by value (gates.c):
 * nothing counts and nothing latches.
 *
 * The floors were measured with each fan at the configured run duty, so
 * a gate judges a fan only at that operating point: while the laser is
 * armed (when a job's own profile may raise a fan but never lower it),
 * or whenever the fan is commanded at or above the run duty. A job that
 * runs its fans slower unarmed (a hunt, with the extraction fans off)
 * is measured and published, not judged.
 *
 * Pure: the engine feeds readings, the host test feeds numbers.
