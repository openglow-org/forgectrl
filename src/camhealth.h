/*
 * camhealth.h - what to do with a frame the capture queue just handed back

 *
 * The capture queue flags a buffer V4L2_BUF_FLAG_ERROR when the frame in it
 * is short, torn or arrived after the receiver lost CSI-2 sync. Such a frame
 * must never reach a demosaic: a snapshot built from one is a corrupt image
 * presented to an operator as a picture of the bed, and a stream built from
 * one is worse because it looks live.
 *
 * The policy is a ladder, kept here rather than inline in the capture loop so
 * it can be exercised without a sensor: drop an errored frame; if they keep
 * coming, cycle the queue, which is what re-synchronizes the receiver; if
 * cycling stops helping, give up and let the engine tear down (clients
 * reconnect, and a reconnect re-runs the whole pipeline setup).
 *
 * The first frames after a stream starts are dropped for a different reason:
 * they were already in flight while the sensor was being programmed, so they
 * predate its exposure settling.
 *
 * Not thread-safe: one struct per capture, touched by the capture thread.
